I use this recipe around late May and early June to use up my turnips.

## Ingredients
* 3 tablespoons of neutral oil
* 1 tablespoon caraway seeds
* 1 tablespoon minced ginger
* 300g peeled turnip cut into wedges
* 1/2 teaspoon of tumeric
* 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder
* 1/4 teaspoon garam masala
* 1 teaspoon sugar


## Steps
1. In a pot, fry caraway seeds until they start to sputter
2. Add minced ginger and fry for about 30 seconds
3. Add turnip wedges and fry for a minute
4. Add tumeric, chili powder, garam masala, sugar, and salt
5. Add a small splash of water, put the lid onto the pot, and cook for 15 minutes on low heat.
6. Take lid off and mash about 1/4 of the turnips, then mix it around. This make it more creamy.
7. Taste for seasoning
