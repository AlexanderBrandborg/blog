I cook this for my wife quite often. It's a great way of using up a lot of vegetables.

* 3 tablespoons of curry powder (S&B is preferred)
* 1 L of stock
* 1 kg of vegetables. Cut into 2x2 cm pieces
* Handful of raisins (Optional)
* Honey (Optional)

## Steps
1. In a big pot, fry the protein in the butter until browned
2. Add the onion and fry for about a minute
3. Add garlic and ginger and fry for about 30 seconds
4. Add the curry and fry for about 30 seconds
5. Add the flour and stir
6. Add the stock bit by bit until all of it is used up
